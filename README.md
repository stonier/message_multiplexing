message_multiplexing
====================

Lightweight embedded messaging system that funnels all communications through a single port with the ability to serialise/deserialise to and from native types. This is especially useful for communications across a LAN to an embedded device with minimal computational capabilities. It uses [nanomsg](http://nanomsg.org/) as a base.
